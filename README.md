#Assorted Shell Projects

This repo acts as a catch-all for any of my smaller shell projects. Anything that isn't large enough, or complex enough to warrant a full dedicated repo.

For the time being it will most likely be practice programs, and small throwaway scripts.

As with all of my projects, everything in this repo is licensed under GNU GPLv3, and is fully available for modification and redistribution as you see fit.

If you have any constructive criticism, please feel free to reach out.
